### Generated Files (3 per company)

1. **`[Company]_CONTACTS.md`**
   - Key decision-makers and influencers
   - Inferred email formats
   - Organizational structure
   - Growth signals

2. **`[Company]_PAIN_POINTS.md`**

   - Technology stack insights

3. **`[Company]_CALL_PREP.md`**
   - Recent company news
   - High-value discovery questions
   - Proven conversation starters

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /mnt/c/dev/sales/Lead-Generation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Test First (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
python test_sales_intelligence.py
```

This processes the first 3 companies:
- Triangle Manufacturing Co., Inc.
- Rockleigh Industries Inc.
- Edgewater Manufacturing Co Inc

**Output**: Creates 9 files in `test_reports/` directory

### Step 3: Review Test Results
```bash
# Check the generated files
ls -lh test_reports/
cat test_reports/Triangle_Manufacturing_Co_Inc_CONTACTS.md
```

### Step 4: Process All 122 Companies
```bash
# Option A: Process all at once (6-10 hours)
python sales_intelligence_research.py

# Option B: Process in batches (RECOMMENDED)
python sales_intelligence_research.py --limit 20 --start 0   # Companies 1-20
python sales_intelligence_research.py --limit 20 --start 20  # Companies 21-40
python sales_intelligence_research.py --limit 20 --start 40  # Companies 41-60
# ... continue until all 122 are processed
```

## 🔑 Authentication

**No API key setup required!**

The system automatically reads your OAuth token from:
```
~/.claude/.credentials.json
```

If you see authentication errors:
1. Make sure you're logged into Claude Code
2. Check that `~/.claude/.credentials.json` exists
3. Or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable as fallback

## 📈 Performance Estimates

**Per Company:**
- Processing time: ~3-5 minutes
- Token usage: ~5,000-8,000 tokens
- Cost: Included in Claude Code subscription

**Full Batch (122 companies):**
- Total time: ~6-10 hours
- Best approach: Run in batches over several sessions
- Monitor `_batch_summary.json` for progress

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Error
```
ValueError: No authentication found
```
**Solution**: Ensure you're logged into Claude Code, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Rate Limiting
If you hit rate limits, the script pauses automatically. You can:
- Process smaller batches (`--limit 10`)
- Increase delay in code (edit `time.sleep(2)` to `time.sleep(5)`)
- Resume later with `--start` flag

### Missing Files
Check `_batch_summary.json` for failed companies:
```bash
cat sales_intelligence_reports/_batch_summary.json | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A5 '"success": false'
```

Reprocess failed companies individually:
```bash
python sales_intelligence_research.py --limit 1 --start 42  # Process company 42
```
