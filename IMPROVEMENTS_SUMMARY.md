# Sales Intelligence Improvements Summary

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Issue:** Fake/empty contact data being generated in research reports

## Problem Identified

The AI systems were generating contacts with empty or placeholder data:
- Empty names with only phone numbers
- Form field labels mistaken for actual contacts
- No validation to reject low-quality contact data

**Example of bad data found:**
```markdown
| Name | Title | Email | Phone | Source |
|------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
|  |  |  | 2018251212 |  |
|  |  |  | 2018251212 |  |
```

**What should have been captured:**
- Email: hello@trianglemfg.com
- Phone: 201.825.1212 Ext. 219
- Name: Sales Team

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Contact Validation Layer (Cerebras Version)

**File:** `intelligent_research/research_orchestrator.py`

**Changes:**
- Added validation in `_save_contact()` method
- Rejects contacts where both name AND email are empty
- Strips whitespace from all fields before validation
- Provides debug output showing why contacts were rejected

**Validation Rules:**
```python
# MUST have at least name OR email
if not name and not email:
    print(f"⚠ Rejected empty contact (no name and no email)")
    return

# Phone-only contacts also rejected
if not name and not email and phone:
    print(f"⚠ Rejected phone-only contact: {phone}")
    return
```

### 2. ✅ Improved AI Prompts (Cerebras Version)

**File:** `intelligent_research/ai_decision_engine.py`

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive contact extraction rules to AI system prompt
- Provided clear examples of good vs bad contacts
- Added validation requirements section
- Included contact extraction strategy guidance

**Key Additions:**
```
=== CRITICAL RULES FOR save_contact ===

**VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS (STRICTLY ENFORCED):**
- MUST provide at least ONE of: name OR email
- Phone-only contacts will be REJECTED
- Empty/blank contacts will be REJECTED
- If you see generic text like "Contact Us" without actual person details, DO NOT save

**GOOD EXAMPLES - These WILL be accepted:**
✓ {"name": "John Smith", "title": "CEO", "email": "john@company.com", "phone": "555-1234"}
✓ {"name": "Sales Team", "title": "Sales", "email": "sales@company.com", "phone": "555-1234"}

**BAD EXAMPLES - These WILL be rejected:**
✗ {"phone": "555-1234"}  // Phone only
✗ {"name": "", "email": "", "phone": "555-1234"}  // Empty fields
```

### 3. ✅ Comprehensive AI Logging (Both Versions)

**Files:**
- `intelligent_research/cerebras_client.py`
- `sales_intelligence_research.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `log_dir` parameter to constructors
- Creates timestamped log files for each AI request
- Logs full prompts, responses, and metadata
- Logs errors with full context

**Log Format:**
```
================================================================================
AI REQUEST #1
Timestamp: 2025-10-24T20:30:45
Model: llama-3.3-70b
================================================================================

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
[Full system prompt with validation rules]

--- USER PROMPT ---
[Company data and research context]

--- AI RESPONSE ---
[Full AI response]

--- RESPONSE METADATA ---
Status: SUCCESS
Usage: {"prompt_tokens": 1234, "completion_tokens": 567}
================================================================================
```

**Benefits:**
- Debug AI decision-making process
- Identify prompt improvements needed
- Track what data AI is seeing vs extracting
- Audit trail for quality improvements

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Prompt Rules (Sales Intelligence Version)

**File:** `sales_intelligence_research.py`

**Changes:**
- Added contact quality rules to Claude CLI prompt
- Clear DO NOT / ONLY include guidelines
- Added fallback message when no contacts found
- Emphasized evidence-based extraction

**Key Additions:**
```markdown
**CRITICAL CONTACT QUALITY RULES:**
❌ **DO NOT include contacts where you only have:**
   - Generic phone numbers without names/emails
   - Form field labels (like "Email *" or "Phone *")
   - Contact form submit buttons without actual contact info

✅ **ONLY include contacts where you have:**
   - ACTUAL person names (e.g., "John Smith", "Jane Doe")
   - Department/role contacts WITH real email addresses
   - Real email addresses even if person name is unknown

**If NO valid contacts found:** State "No specific contacts identified on public website.
Recommend LinkedIn prospecting or direct phone inquiry."
```

## Files Modified

### Cerebras Intelligent Research System
1. `intelligent_research/research_orchestrator.py` - Contact validation
2. `intelligent_research/ai_decision_engine.py` - Improved AI prompts
3. `intelligent_research/cerebras_client.py` - AI interaction logging

### Sales Intelligence Research System
1. `sales_intelligence_research.py` - Contact quality rules + AI logging

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Running Production

1. **Test with Triangle Manufacturing:**
   ```bash
   python cerebras_intelligent_research.py --csv google_maps_leads.csv --limit 1 --max-iterations 3
   ```

2. **Check AI Logs:**
   ```bash
   ls -la ai_logs/
   cat ai_logs/request_001_*.log
   ```

3. **Verify Contact Quality:**
   - Open generated markdown reports
   - Ensure contacts have real names/emails
   - Check for rejected contact warnings in console output

4. **Review Validation Output:**
   Look for messages like:
   ```
   ⚠ Rejected empty contact (no name and no email)
   ⚠ Rejected phone-only contact: 2018251212
   ✓ Saved contact: Sales Team - Sales
      Email: sales@company.com
      Phone: 201.825.1212
   ```

### Expected Improvements

- **0 empty contacts** in generated reports
- **All contacts have name OR email** at minimum
- **AI logs available** for debugging in `ai_logs/` directory
- **Clear console output** showing validation decisions

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the improvements** with 1-2 companies
2. **Review AI logs** to see what data AI is receiving vs extracting
3. **Iterate on prompts** if AI still misidentifying contacts
4. **Run batch processing** once validation is confirmed working
5. **Monitor quality** over first 10-20 companies

## Additional Notes

- The Cerebras version (`cerebras_intelligent_research.py`) is currently being tested
- The sales intelligence version (`sales_intelligence_research.py`) is ready for testing
- Both versions now have identical validation philosophy and logging capabilities
- AI logs will help identify additional edge cases for future improvements
