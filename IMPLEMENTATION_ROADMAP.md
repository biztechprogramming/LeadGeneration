- **Linear processing:** Company → AI → Reports
- **Single data source:** CSV input only
- **No iteration:** Single AI pass per company
- **Basic output:** 3 markdown files per company
- **Current cost:** ~$1-3 (Cerebras) or included (Claude)
- **Current time:** ~20 min (Cerebras) or 6-10 hours (Claude) for all 122

### Target State (Iterative System)
- **Multi-stage processing:** 5 analysis iterations per company
- **Multi-source data:** Website, LinkedIn, news, images, records
- **Intelligent iteration:** AI guides data collection
- **Enhanced output:** Reports + metadata + images + iteration logs
- **Expected cost:** +$5-20 (additional API calls, image storage)
- **Expected time:** ~1-2 hours per company (or parallel processing)

## Detailed Implementation Approach

### Website Scraping (Priority 1)

**Options Analysis:**

| Option | Effort | Quality | Cost | Best For |
|--------|--------|---------|------|----------|
| Firecrawl MCP | Low | Excellent | Medium | High-quality content |
| Playwright Direct | Medium | Very Good | Low | Flexible scraping |
| HTTP + BeautifulSoup | Low | Good | Low | Simple text extraction |

**Recommendation:** Start with Playwright (already in dependencies), advance to Firecrawl if needed.

### Data Source Priority

1. **Website Content** (Phase 1) - Highest ROI, 85% coverage
2. **LinkedIn** (Phase 2) - Leadership data, company info
3. **News/Press** (Phase 2) - Recent activity, announcements
4. **Images** (Phase 3) - Team composition, office layout
5. **Business Records** (Future) - Registration, history, officers

### API Selection

**LinkedIn:**
- Option 1: Puppeteer/Playwright scraping (free, ToS concerns)
- Option 2: LinkedIn API official (requires approval)
- Option 3: Third-party APIs (costly but reliable)
- **Recommendation:** Start with Playwright, monitor for blocks

**News:**
- Option 1: Google News API (free tier available)
- Option 2: NewsAPI (inexpensive, good coverage)
- Option 3: Bing News API (alternative)
- **Recommendation:** NewsAPI ($50/month) for reliability

**Images:**
- Use `aiohttp` for parallel downloads
- Store in organized directory structure
- Use `Pillow` for image processing/validation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **LinkedIn Terms of Service** - Scraping may violate ToS
   - Mitigation: Use official API or pause LinkedIn collection
   - Fallback: Identify alternative data sources

2. **API Rate Limiting** - Multiple simultaneous requests
   - Mitigation: Implement exponential backoff, request queuing
   - Fallback: Stagger requests, increase processing time

### Medium Risk
3. **Data Quality Variance** - Some companies have better public info
   - Mitigation: Confidence scoring, manual review for low scores
   - Fallback: Flag for manual research

4. **Image Storage** - Thousands of images could get large
   - Mitigation: Compress images, selective storage
   - Fallback: Cloud storage with cost controls

### Low Risk
5. **Implementation Complexity** - Multi-stage system is complex
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, clear documentation
   - Fallback: Simplify to fewer stages
