# Citation System Implementation - Complete

## ✅ Implementation Complete for `sales_intelligence_research.py`

The citation system has been successfully implemented with **comprehensive, granular citation tracking** for every single fact captured during research.

## What Changed

### Updated Prompt in `sales_intelligence_research.py`

The AI prompt now includes **extensive citation requirements** that mandate:

1. **Every fact gets a citation marker**: Names, titles, emails, phones, pain points, evidence, technologies, news items, company info, departments
2. **Markdown footnote syntax**: [^1], [^2], [^3], etc.
3. **Citation reuse for same URL**: Multiple facts from same source share citation number
4. **Different URL = different citation**: Each unique source gets unique number
5. **Citations section at end of each file**: All URLs listed with [^n]: URL format
